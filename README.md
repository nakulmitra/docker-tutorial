# 🐳 Docker Tutorial - From Beginner to Pro

Welcome to the **Complete Docker Learning Repository**!

This repo covers both **theory** and **hands-on examples** of Docker - designed for both beginners and experienced developers.

## What is Docker?

Docker is a containerization platform that allows us to package our applications and dependencies into containers - lightweight, portable, and isolated environments.

Think of it like this:
* Traditional apps run on OS directly -> prone to conflicts
* Docker apps run inside isolated "containers" -> consistent behavior everywhere

Example Analogy:
> If your app is a ship, Docker containers are like sealed cargo containers - they carry your goods (code + dependencies) safely across any ship (OS/environment).

## Why Use Docker?

* `Consistency:` Works the same on dev, staging, and production
* `Isolation:` No dependency conflicts
* `Portability:` Run anywhere (Windows, macOS, Linux, Cloud)
* `Scalability:` Ideal for microservices and cloud deployment
* `Efficiency:`Lightweight compared to virtual machines

## Key Docker Concepts

| Term           | Description                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Image**      | Blueprint of your app (read-only template) |
| **Container**  | Running instance of an image               |
| **Dockerfile** | Script defining how an image is built      |
| **Volume**     | Persistent storage for containers          |
| **Network**    | Enables communication between containers   |
| **Registry**   | Repository for images (e.g., Docker Hub)   |
