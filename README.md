# 🐳 Docker Tutorial - From Beginner to Pro

Welcome to the **Complete Docker Learning Repository**!

This repo covers both **theory** and **hands-on examples** of Docker - designed for both beginners and experienced developers.

# What is Docker?

Docker is a containerization platform that allows us to package our applications and dependencies into containers - lightweight, portable, and isolated environments.

Think of it like this:
* Traditional apps run on OS directly -> prone to conflicts
* Docker apps run inside isolated "containers" -> consistent behavior everywhere

Example Analogy:
> If your app is a ship, Docker containers are like sealed cargo containers - they carry your goods (code + dependencies) safely across any ship (OS/environment).
